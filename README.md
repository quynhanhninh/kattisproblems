# 3 Kattis problems
My solutions, using Python language, to three [Kattis problems](https://open.kattis.com/problems).
The programs use key concepts in Python programming for beginners, such as string manipulation, lists, and loops.

## Problem Description
1. *[Run-Length Encoding, Run!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/runlengthencodingrun)*: A program that encode/decodes a line of text following the run-length compression scheme.
> When encoding a text string, repeated consecutive characters are replaced by a single instance of that character and the number of occurrences of that character (the characterâ€™s run length). Decoding the encoded string results in the original string by repeating each character the number of times encoded by the run length.
2. *[Cudoviste](https://open.kattis.com/problems/cudoviste)*: A program that checks the possible parking slots (2x2 cells) from any input map by calculating the number of cars that will be squashed for parking spaces.
3. *[Backspace](https://open.kattis.com/problems/backspace)*: A program that fixes the backspace error of the text editor, by deleting the "<" character and its preceding character in a line of text.

## Other information
The three programs included in this repository provide corresponding solutions to each of the listed problems above.

I solved these problems by myself. The total amount of time I spent on each problem, including reading prompt, writing and fixing codes, and proofreading/formatting, is as follow:
- Problem #1 - *Run-Length Encoding, Run!*: 2 hours
- Problem #2 - *Cudoviste*: 1 hour
- Problem #3 - *Backspace*: 45 minutes

Any comments on the programs or feedback to improve my logics are welcomed!
